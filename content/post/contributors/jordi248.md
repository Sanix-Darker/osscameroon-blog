Hello everyone, my name is ANAFACK Diderot Jordan (Jordi_248). I am a software engineer. I am a computer enthusiast in general but I am more specialized in web development in which I already have 4 years of experience and more recently I started the mobile development with flutter. I am comfortable with the following languages: php, python, javascript, java, c. I am as comfortable with backend technologies as front-end technologies.

In addition to this I have the skills in Machine Learning & Deep Learning and my biggest fantasy is to create a **Jordi AI** where my pseudo comes from. I have already started this project 2 years ago. what will it consist of exactly? and What will be the features? ... I will answer you with haste when the time comes.
I'm there to learn and also share my knowledge thanks...
