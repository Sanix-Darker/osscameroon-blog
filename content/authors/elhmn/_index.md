Software Engineer at [GitHub](https://github.com/), I build video games, draw and play piano.

I felt in love with code while playing video games, and got the chance to study software development, at [Ecole 42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) in Paris.

I currently spend most of my time providing support to aspiring developers from Cameroon and maintaining osscameroon's open-source projects.
